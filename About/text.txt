              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I'm Yash, a web developer
              from Mumbai, India. Currently pursuing a bachelor's degree focused
              in Computer Application from Shailendra Education Society's
              College of Arts Commerce and Science. I'm young and passionate
              about my work. As a web developer, I believe good development is
              about having knowledge about frontend and backend and how those
              two platforms connect.Addicted to music, visual arts, and games.
